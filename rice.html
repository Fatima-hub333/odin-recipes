    <h5>Steps
        <ol>
            <li> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and lightly grease paper and sides of the pan with cooking spray.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>Stir graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a medium bowl until well combined. Pour graham cracker crumb mixture into the prepared pan and press firmly into the bottom and sides to create a crust.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Step 3</strong>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and firm, about 10 minutes. Remove pan from the oven and set aside to cool completely at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Wrap the outsides of the pan tightly with aluminum foil; set aside.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Step 4</strong>Beat ricotta, mascarpone, 1 cup sugar, and flour together in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on low speed until smooth, scraping down the sides with a spatula as needed. Add 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, lemon zest, and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon and continue beating on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed until well combined.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Step 5</strong>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and lightly grease paper and sides of the pan with cooking spray.</p></li>
